# Your mobile application

**A**. Proposed name: **Forgotten worlds**

**B**. Target Users: People that struggle with forgetting things (even forgetting to visit reminder application).

**C**. Main features and functionality: Planning tasks and setting reminders.

**D**: Elements of innovation: the application uses some form of gamification. The user has own world that evolves or gets destroyed. If user completes created tasks, he/she receives reward (item) to the world (new trees, stones, animals and so on). If the task is forgotten, world gets slowly destroyed. By this innovation we bound user's emotional attention not to the tasks but their worlds that they should take care of.
